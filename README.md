# ALU
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog that supports 16 operations, including arithmetic (addition, subtraction with/without carry, increment, decrement), logical (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NOT), data transfer (pass A, pass B), and shift operations, with four status flags Carry (C), Zero (Z), Sign (S), and Parity (P) generated for each result. The design was written in Verilog HDL, simulated using a comprehensive testbench, and verified in Vivado through behavioral simulation waveforms as well as RTL elaboration and schematic view, ensuring correctness of operations and flag outputs. The project demonstrates modular digital design principles, hardware description language implementation, and functional verification, making it useful as a learning reference for digital design and computer architecture concepts.
